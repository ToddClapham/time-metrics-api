  2. Change the branch name in `ts-deploy-to-dev.yml` to the branch you would like to deploy
  3. Set the secrets and variables in your repository's settings page:
     - SSH_PRIVATE_KEY: private key for the machine to deploy to
     - REMOTE_HOST: IP address of the machine to deploy to (e.g. 255.255.255.255)
